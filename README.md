# DevFolio â€“ My Portfolio Website

Hi there! DevFolio is my fourth project, and itâ€™s a portfolio website I built using Bootstrap. I wanted to keep things simple and clean while making sure itâ€™s easy to use and looks great on any device. Itâ€™s all about showcasing my work and skills in a way that feels professional but also approachable.

## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s Inside?
- **ðŸ“± Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktops, tablets, and phones â€“ no pinching or zooming needed!
- **âš¡ Built with Bootstrap**: I used Bootstrap to whip up interactive components, speed up development, and keep the design clean and professional.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built It
- I wanted to challenge myself and see what I could do with Bootstrap while getting better at responsive design. It was a fun way to level up my skills and build something Iâ€™m really proud of!

## ðŸ“¸ Preview
